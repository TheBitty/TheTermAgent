# Feature Specification: MVP Terminal Implementation

## Feature Name:
Basic Terminal Functionality with Command Execution

## Problem Statement:
We need a working terminal that can execute system commands before adding AI features. Currently, the main.py file has incomplete implementation and the terminal loop is not functional.

## Proposed Solution:
Implement a basic terminal that:
1. Displays a prompt
2. Accepts user input
3. Executes commands via subprocess
4. Shows command output
5. Handles basic errors
6. Supports command history

## Requirements:

### Functional Requirements:
1. Interactive terminal loop that accepts commands
2. Execute any system command using subprocess
3. Display command output (stdout and stderr)
4. Handle Ctrl+C gracefully
5. Support basic commands: exit, clear, cd
6. Command history with arrow keys
7. Current directory in prompt

### Non-functional Requirements:
1. **Performance**: Command execution < 50ms overhead
2. **Security**: Basic command validation
3. **Reliability**: Graceful error handling
4. **Usability**: Familiar terminal experience
5. **Compatibility**: Linux, macOS, Windows support

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Terminal displays prompt with current directory
- [ ] User can type and execute commands
- [ ] Output displays correctly
- [ ] cd command changes directory
- [ ] exit command closes terminal
- [ ] Command history works with up/down arrows
- [ ] Ctrl+C interrupts running commands
- [ ] Errors display without crashing

## Technical Design Notes:

### Architecture Overview:
```
main.py (Terminal Loop)
    ↓
command_handler.py (Command Processing)
    ↓
subprocess (System Execution)
```

### Key Components:
1. **TerminalSession**: Main terminal loop and state
2. **CommandHandler**: Validates and executes commands
3. **PromptManager**: Formats and displays prompt

### Implementation Phases:
1. **Phase 1**: Basic terminal loop with command execution
2. **Phase 2**: Command history and special commands
3. **Phase 3**: Error handling and cross-platform support

## Self-Validation/Testing Plan:

### Manual Tests:
- [ ] Run basic commands: ls, pwd, echo
- [ ] Change directories with cd
- [ ] Test command history
- [ ] Test Ctrl+C handling
- [ ] Test error commands
- [ ] Test on different OS

### Automated Tests:
```python
def test_command_execution():
    """Test basic command execution"""
    handler = CommandHandler()
    result = handler.execute("echo 'test'")
    assert result.stdout.strip() == "test"
    assert result.exit_code == 0

def test_cd_command():
    """Test directory change"""
    original = os.getcwd()
    handler = CommandHandler()
    handler.execute("cd /tmp")
    assert os.getcwd() == "/tmp"
    os.chdir(original)
```

## Next Steps After This Feature:
1. Add safety validation for dangerous commands
2. Implement AI provider integration
3. Add command help with ? suffix
4. Implement auto-completion
