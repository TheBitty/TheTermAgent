### Data Model:
```python
# Example data structures or schemas
class FeatureData:
    field1: str
    field2: int
    field3: Optional[List[str]]
```

### API Design:
```python
# Example API endpoints or interfaces
def feature_endpoint(param1: str, param2: int) -> Result:
    """
    Brief description of what this does.
    """
    pass
```

### Dependencies:
- [External libraries or services required]
- [Internal modules that need modification]
- [Configuration changes needed]

### Implementation Phases:
1. **Phase 1**: [Initial implementation - core functionality]
2. **Phase 2**: [Enhanced features]
3. **Phase 3**: [Polish and optimization]

## Self-Validation/Testing Plan:

### Unit Tests:
```python
# Example test cases
def test_feature_basic_functionality():
    """Test that feature performs its core function."""
    # Arrange
    # Act
    # Assert

def test_feature_edge_cases():
    """Test edge cases and error conditions."""
    # Test implementation
```

### Integration Tests:
